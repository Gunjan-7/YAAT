# Fuzzie Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the Fuzzie application's performance after upgrading to Next.js 15.3.1 and React 19.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Component Optimizations

- **SparklesCore Component**: Optimized particle rendering with dynamic adjustment based on device capability
- **Scroll Animations**: Implemented efficient scroll animations with debounced event handlers
- **Mobile Navigation**: Added optimized mobile navigation with smooth transitions
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented proper lazy loading for images and components

### 2. Performance Utilities

- **Performance Monitoring**: Added tools to track FPS, memory usage, and page load metrics
- **Device Detection**: Automatically detect low-end devices and adjust visual effects accordingly
- **Debounce & Throttle**: Implemented utility functions to limit expensive operations
- **Animation Optimization**: Reduced animation complexity on low-end devices

### 3. Next.js Configuration

- **Image Optimization**: Configured Next.js image optimization for faster loading
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: Optimized package imports to reduce bundle size
- **Console Cleanup**: Removed console logs in production while preserving errors and warnings
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized memory usage with proper page buffer settings

## How to Monitor Performance

During development, you can enable the performance monitor by adding `?perf=true` to any URL. For example:

```
http://localhost:3000/?perf=true
```

This will display a small performance monitor in the bottom-left corner showing:
- Current FPS (frames per second)
- Memory usage
- Device capability
- First Contentful Paint time

## Performance Hooks

We've added custom React hooks to help with performance optimization:

### usePerformanceOptimization

This hook automatically adjusts application settings based on device capability and runtime performance:

```tsx
const { 
  enableAnimations, 
  reducedMotion,
  particleCount,
  optimizeImages,
  disableParallax
} = usePerformanceOptimization();
```

### useOptimizedImageLoading

Provides optimized image loading props:

```tsx
const imageProps = useOptimizedImageLoading(priority);
// Use with Next.js Image component
<Image {...imageProps} src="/image.jpg" alt="Description" />
```

### useOptimizedAnimations

Provides animation settings based on device capability:

```tsx
const { 
  enableAnimations, 
  getAnimationProps 
} = useOptimizedAnimations();

// Use with framer-motion
<motion.div {...getAnimationProps('fade')}>
  Content
</motion.div>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Avoid Layout Thrashing**: Batch DOM reads and writes to prevent layout thrashing
2. **Optimize Event Handlers**: Use debounce/throttle for scroll and resize events
3. **Use Hardware Acceleration**: Add `will-change: transform` for elements that animate frequently
4. **Reduce Particle Count**: Lower particle counts on low-end devices
5. **Optimize Images**: Use proper sizes and formats for images
6. **Lazy Load Off-Screen Content**: Only load content when it's needed

## Troubleshooting

If you experience performance issues:

1. Enable the performance monitor with `?perf=true` to identify bottlenecks
2. Check for low FPS during animations
3. Monitor memory usage for leaks
4. Review network requests for slow loading resources
5. Test on low-end devices to ensure good performance across all platforms
